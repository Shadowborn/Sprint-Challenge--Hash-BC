Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:

What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove 
from the front, and add or remove from the back?

	Accessing the array: O(1) because it takes a single step
	Adding/removing from the end: O(n) sometimes O(1) 
	Adding/removing from the Beginning: O(n) always

What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage 
size of a dynamic array?
	
	You would need to copy the old data into the new array
    blockchain is most like a linked list
    hashes are what points to next

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what
is the chain? How is the data organized?

	each block is hashed with the one before it, creating a chain 
	of data where one would need to change every block in the chain
	before it was verified by the community in order to spoof it.
    It is a very hard brute force problem 

Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does 
this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

	You would need over 51 percent of mining power to take over,
	It's a consensus algorithm in a Blockchain network. In Blockchain, 
	this algorithm is used to confirm transactions and produce new 
	blocks to the chain. With PoW, miners compete against each other 
	to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded
